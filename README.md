# Web-Quiz-Engine

**Spring Boot** provides a way to build production-ready Spring applications with minimal 
setup time.

In this project, we develop a multi-users web service for creating and solving 
quizzes (or questions).  

It is all about backend development where we apply **REST API**, **JPA** (implementation 
_Hibernate_), embedded database like _H2_, security, and other technologies.

We use :  
- **_H2 database_** to stock the data. It provides a fast in-memory database that supports 
JDBC API. Supports embedded and server modes as well as browser based console application. 
It's used by the most developer in dev environment to test the application.
- _**Spring security**_ to handle authentication and authorization of a user to different 
  services.
- _**Postman**_ to test our _API_ by creating and sending request as _client_. 
  [Postman](https://www.postman.com) is a collaboration platform for API development. 
  It's a client REST.
- And other technologies in Spring Boot platform.

For the rest of this project, we could develop a web/mobile client for this web service.
