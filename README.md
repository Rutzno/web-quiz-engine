# Web-Quiz-Engine

**Spring Boot** provides a way to build production-ready Spring applications with minimal 
setup time.

In this project, we develop a multi-users web service for creating and solving 
quizzes (or questions).  

It is all about backend development where we apply **REST API**, embedded database like H2, 
security, and other technologies.

We use :  
- **_H2 database_** to stock the data. It provides a fast in-memory database that supports 
JDBC API. Supports embedded and server modes as well as browser based console application. 
It's used by the most developer in dev environment to test the application.
- _**Spring security**_ to handle authentication and authorization of a user to different 
  services.
- And other technologies in Spring Boot platform.
